-Need to "explode" the parcel data
-Need to drop blocks/parcels with zero population, or low population, but not sure at which point.
-could I develop a composite mhps layer that is the best of both? Could I intersect the points with roads to filter/choose?
 
-maybe before doing that find the double hits and compare versions
-going to have to do the comparison before 

-A consistent problem occurs when a county gov includes streets as parcels, then that particular county has a lot of mismatches.


-Next: find out which mhps matched in each version but did not match in the other. 


-what if I dropped all rows of the parcel data where length of the geometry exceeds some typical amount? This may help get rid of roads.... DID This and worked.

Next:



Redo the compare versions for DOUBLE HITS (same mhp same parcel), DIFFERENCES (same mhp different parcel); UNIQUES (mhps parcels not in the other dataset), NON-MATCH mhps

-Overall 684 MHPs in Colorado, regeocoded mhps got 442 matches, original got 211 matches. 178 mhps in common were matched in each version, but not always to the same parcel: 72 were DIFFERENCES, 106 DOUBLE HITS. (These were found by merging). **NOTE REDO THIS** 58/93 original was correct; 18 regeocoded were correct; 17 were either both wrong, both right, or uncertain.

UNIQUES: 300 UNIQUES overall, 264 UNIQUE mhp matches in regeocoded data, 36 UNIQUE mhp matches in original data.

NON-MATCH: 209 not matched by either version.
