-Need to "explode" the parcel data
-Need to drop blocks/parcels with zero population, or low population, but not sure at which point.
-could I develop a composite mhps layer that is the best of both? Could I intersect the points with roads to filter/choose?
 
-maybe before doing that find the double hits and compare versions
-going to have to do the comparison before 

-A consistent problem occurs when a county gov includes streets as parcels, then that particular county has a lot of mismatches.


-Next: find out which mhps matched in each version but did not match in the other. 


-what if I dropped all rows of the parcel data where length of the geometry exceeds some typical amount? This may help get rid of roads.... DID This and worked.

Next:



Redo the compare versions for DOUBLE HITS (same mhp same parcel), DIFFERENCES (same mhp different parcel); UNIQUES (mhps parcels not in the other dataset), NON-MATCH mhps

-Overall 684 MHPs in Colorado, regeocoded mhps got 442 matches, original got 211 matches. 178 mhps in common were matched in each version, but not always to the same parcel: 72 were DIFFERENCES, 106 DOUBLE HITS. (These were found by merging). 52/72 original was correct; 7 regeocoded were correct; 7 were either both wrong, 6 both right. 
** Originals most often correct... maybe start w/ originals then supplement with regeocoded?

Next: examine regeocoded uniques?

UNIQUES: 300 UNIQUES overall, 264 UNIQUE mhp matches in regeocoded data, 36 UNIQUE mhp matches in original data.

NON-MATCH: 209 not matched by either version.

********
Reviewed the accuracy of regeocoded mhp-parcels and original mhp-parcels:
Original much more accurate!

Regeocoded had 442 matches, but 190 of them were wrong, making a 57% accuracy rate

Original had 211 matches, but only 25 were wrong! 88% accuracy rate

Among the unique regeocoded MHP-parcels (mhp-parcel not matched using the original data but matched in the regeocoded), 130 out of 264 were WRONG, only 50% match rate. So these weren't accurately matched anyway. 

However, of the 684 MHPs, 211 matched (88% accurate). That's only 30%. (or 186 matched/27% if you account for accuracy rate)

Changed strategy to using a near join. This works better, however, I've discovered that 
that the geometry length zscore filtering method is sometimes removing good ones
and leaving in bad ones. Need to refine this before I can really determine
how well the near is working.

For tomorrow: try simplifying geometries prior to calculating the geometry length zscore

What's going on with Larimer county???
Add a line to drop dupes based on apn2 if apn1 is null? no
dedupe based on geometry column? <<<Did this

Yesterday figured out how incorporate interior geometries and use that as a filtering mechanism 
(get rid of street grids)

Today worked on integrating microsoft buildings data. 
-split data I already have into correct directories
-created a summarize within function to count buildigns within parcels, 
-incorporated this into parcelMHPJoin function
-discovered that broomfield county was missing (08014). 
-My source data for county fips and county names was old!!!
-Fix Monday, then continue evaluating if buildings can be used

12/4/23
********
Got buildings successfully incorporated, and now used to filter.
Steps: 
1) drop all parcels w/ interior geom length greater than 20
2) drop all parcels where external geometry Z score > 3 AND sumWithin (buildings count) < 10

This is working well

To do tomorrow:
-investigate all parcels w/ zero sum_Within
-select double hits based on sum_within or nearest or some combination
-email Emily
-email Kevin Worthington


12/5/23

-trying to determine criteria for deciding which parcel to keep
-increase near distance to 10 (perhaps examine a second round of results at 15 m)
-choose the one with buildings--at least 2
-if no double hit, just leave it in(?) TBD... or perhaps not. Ask Emily?
-if both (or multiple) have a lot of buildigs, keep both
-if both zero buildings, drop both
-should just drop all parcels w/ zero buidings?

-Got rid of all 0s, compared all double hits and selected the one
with the most buildings, dropped all remaining 1s.

-95% correct!

12/6/23
********

-multipart polygon rabbit hole
-tomorrow: check differences between explode results and multipart results

12/7/23
********
Examined multipart vs exploded: Multipart is better!

expanded near join to 15m, need to examine the results more closely:
-split off matches from 15m join that were not matched in 10m join

-oddly, it seems that when I combine the mh-parcel files into one state wide file,
it stores all geometries as multigeometry. I don't know why.


For 12/12/23
********
-Drop all parcels w/ fewer than 5 buildings. *all of the matches with 4 were wrong half the time.
-see what the match rate is when accounting for counties where parcel data is missing
-need to figure out warnings.

Questions for Emily:
Leave in duplicate geometries? (that is, when 2 points match with the same parcel)
How many mobile homes qualifies a parcel as an MHP? (< 30, but I'll start w/ 20)

To do:
Work on filtering mechanism when there are parcels matched with multiple mhps.

12/13/23
*********

Turned out the filtering mechanism was not really the place to address the
problem of wrong matches for right reason. This all stemmed from the duplicate geometries question.

Ended up reworking the near join process, breaking things up into smaller functions as well
-Turns out the near was going the opposite direction than I though (parcel to mhp), 
-switched to mhp-parcel nearest, then joined them back to parcel with just a table join
-then took the unmatched and did a parcel-mhp nearest to grab the results
-then concatted the first join and second join
-same results (well, slightly improved) but no more 'right for the wrong reason' matches.

Tomorrow: select only medium+ (20 or 30 minimum), carry over some more columns from original mhp data
into final data.

1/2/24

-Working well.

Questions for Emily:
-Fields to carry over?
-How to approach/figure out success rate in identifying parcels.

1/5/24

Need to fix: get rid of MHP_{fips}.csv files, resplit the original state file into counties with that name
Rename output so it doesn't overwrite
figure out problem with field types (fips getting messed up)
Get clarity on what emily wants.

Been testing matching just on simple table merge w/ apn, but only works about 50% 
of the time, worse than my algorithm. 

-Need to check accuracy of the correct 50% though...
-How can I incorporate this?
-To do:
1. incorporate apn
2. incorporate building/unit numbers as a check
3. feasible to incorporate ownership? 

-First run APN match (keep non matches) and add column T/F for APN match
-Then run geo matching process, resulting in some double matches
-Group parcels by... geom?... and drop duplicates where APN match is False

-Need to sum sum_within when grouped by APN, how different from MH_UNITS... 
-if very different, FLAG for inspection? Or drop if APN-MHAPN differ? Or if APN match is false?

2/1/24

-Incorporated apn pre merge followed by geo merge, but have not weeded out
 duplicated parcels yet.

-need to compute sum_within/MH_UNITS proportions into a new columns, perhaps sort by
 then can drop below a percentage???

 2/7/24
 -Finally got the sum_within/MH_units filter worked out yesterday--works!!!! 
 -downloaded all 2010 and 2000 blocks boundaries for Colorado
 -integrated 2000 and 2010 workflows into parcelfunks, but untested
 -need to finish working 2000 and 2010 workflows into main.py
